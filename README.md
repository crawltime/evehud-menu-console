# evehud menu console

---

Taken from: [e.v.e HUD kleen edition](https://gamebanana.com/mods/293211)
I edited the mainmenuoverride.res and gamemenu.res to have the appropriate code that adds the console like kleen edition has. I also added the appropriate console vmt and vtf texture files that requires a material directory.

That is all.

Install:

Place content inside the zip into your evehud root directory, replace the files and that's everything.
